# js-interactive-reg-form
This project is an interactive registration form that validates user input for a fictional full stack conference.
If the "submit" button is clicked while any or all of the required user inputs are empty/invalid, the form does not submit, 
keyboard focus directs the user's attention to the error, and a helpful "hint" message is revealed.
